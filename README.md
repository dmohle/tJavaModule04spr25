Java Zoo (midterm program) Practice Assignment
Objective:
Enhance your understanding of Java control structures, data structures, file I/O, and OOP design through the "Java Zoo Practice" application. This project will prepare you for the major midterm program by processing information from a file, managing animal data, and generating a report.

Background:
The zoo has received a list of new animals. Your task is to organize this information, process it, and prepare a report on the animals, including their specific enclosures.

Important:
This program is a vital step towards preparing for your major midterm project. If you find yourself needing help, consider getting a tutor, joining our Discord server, forming a study group, or finding a lab partner.

Requirements:

Class Design:

Create an Animal class with the properties name, age, and species. Include a constructor, getters, and setters.
Develop four subclasses: Hyena, Lion, Tiger, and Bear, each with unique features.
Data Structures:

Use ArrayList for storing animal instances and HashMap for counting species.
File I/O:

Read animal details from arrivingAnimals.txt, and animalNames.txt and output a report to newAnimals.txt, listing animals by species, their names, ages, and the total count of each species.
Control Structures & OOP Design:

Apply loops, conditionals, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism as specified.
Tasks:

Design and implement the Animal class and its subclasses.
Process animal instances from the input file using Java data structures.
Output a report with the format specified.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit well-commented source code.
Include a report explaining your design and implementation.
Reach out for help if needed to ensure you're fully prepared for the upcoming midterm project.
This assignment is an excellent opportunity to solidify your understanding of key Java concepts in a practical context while also gearing up for a significant upcoming evaluation. Make the most of the resources available to you to excel in this project and beyond.
